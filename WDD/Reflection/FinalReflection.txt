I decided to primarily use the feedback given by Brian Green because from the detail given in his responses, I could tell he actually analyzed what was presented to him. I got a few responses that commented on the color choice, so I made edits to that. Brian suggested I add an option that allowed users to select their own theme – added. Annaya said the colors should pop and be more enticing – added. Dantise said the design was bland, so I added various colors to appeal to this concern as well.Some other options I added based off of feedback were:Ability to chat with stylistsA subscription tab in the menu window to view channels subscribed toThe feedback I didn’t apply was from Phil, his reason for not liking the application. In a way the layout is similar to Facebook. Slide sideways for like items in a category. Slide down to find more categories.Something I noticed amongst most of the responders is that there was confusion about what the app was even for. Next go around, instead of providing pictures and questions then telling everyone to have at it, I should provide a brief description of the app’s purpose and what their feedback is needed for.
